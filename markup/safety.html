<div class="hometitle">Our Safety Philosophy</div>
<div class="contentbody">Safety is paramount for us at SD Skate Life. A key element of our program is making sure new skateboarders learn proper skateboarding safety from day one. This includes learning how to fall the right way vs. the wrong way, collision prevention, and practicing skate park etiquette to decrease the chance of injury.  We take pride in all of our instructors being First Aid/CPR Certified and will do everything we can to make your skateboarding experience as pain free and pleasant as can be!</div>
<div class="contentbody"><strong>What to Bring?</strong></div>
<div class="contentbody">We <strong>REQUIRE</strong> that helmets be worn at all times during lessons with our instructors. We highly recommend the use of elbow pads, knee pads, and wrist protectors for beginners. Parents/Students will be required to sign a release of liability waiver upon sign up or first lesson.</div>
<div class="contentbody">SD SkateLife makes safety its number one priority. Therefore, participants must wear helmets at all times according to CA state law, whether on the streets, in a skate park, or at your home. For a specific look at the law follow this link:</div>
