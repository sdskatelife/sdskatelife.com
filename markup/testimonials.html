        <h3>Jenny Oberhand, Parent:</h3>
        <p>"My husband and I feel extremely grateful to have found such an excellent skateboard instructor for our daughter! Since she has been taking lessons with Andy, she has learned how to do so many tricks and also gained a tremendous amount of self confidence!
I would recommend Andrew Barbosa to anyone who wants to learn or master skateboarding. He is extremely nice, reliable, encouraging and an absolute pleasure to be with!"</p>

        <h3>Mike Barclay, Parent:</h3>
        <p>"I am a life long educator. What Andrew and his staff did in two weeks for my children was incredible from a personal and professional standpoint. My son is a natural skateboarder. Andrew took his raw skill and transformed him into a legit little skateboarder. For my daughter, I will always be grateful for the time and energy Andrew put into teaching her how to skateboard. Her confidence level has never been higher and this I owe all to Andrew. SD Skatelife taught my daughter to be comfortable in her skin and not to be afraid of taking a risk (calculated safe, risks at that). What she learned during her time with Andrew was that taking risks like 'dropping in' may be scary, but the feeling of accomplishment of overcoming your fear is life changing, even for an eight year old girl."</p><br/>
        <p>"The culture of respect for oneself and each other Andrew creates during his camps is second to none. The kids have a great time, parents know their children are safe, and everyone walks away totally psyched. I highly recommend SD Skatelife to anyone interested in introducing their child to skateboarding for the first time or to help your child take raw skill and take it to the next level. SD Skatelife ROCKS!!!" </p>

        <h3>Sabrina, Student:</h3>
        <p>"As an adult female, I was extremely intimidated about getting on a skateboard and going to a skatepark.  However, it was something I wanted to do after not touching a board for 20 odd years.  Luckily I found Andrew, who really made all the things I worried about seem like they were completely irrelevant.  He really cares about making you feel comfortable, confident and having fun and he does this by taking things at the pace I am most comfortable, yet pushes me each time so that I do improve every time.  Andrew has the patience of a saint and goes out of his way to make sure you get what you want out of each lesson.  He knows what he is doing, and actually cares - this is more than apparent.  I would recommend him without a doubt to any adult or child.  Thank you Andrew!"</p>

        <h3>Sara McKellar, Parent:</h3>
        <p>"Our daughter fell in love with skateboarding on a family camping trip where she tried it for the first time. For her next birthday we bought her a skateboard of her own and she spent everyday, day after day, riding up and down the driveway. Our neighborhood streets didn't offer a safe place for her to learn so I went looking for an alternative. That's when I found SD Skatelife's skateboarding classes. Wow, I'm so glad I did! Our daughter quickly learned a bunch of tricks that I didn't even know existed! Coach Andrew and Coach Kaleb were perfect-- fun, professional, nice, encouraging and above all great instructors. They teach every aspect of skateboarding from the ground up, break down the tricks into incremental steps and are literally right there with the kids every step of the way."</p>
