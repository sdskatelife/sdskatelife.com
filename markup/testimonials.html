<div class="contentbody">"My husband and I feel extremely grateful to have found such an excellent skateboard instructor for our daughter! Since she has been taking lessons with Andy, she has learned how to do so many tricks and also gained a tremendous amount of self confidence!</div>
<div class="contentbody">"I would recommend Andrew Barbosa to anyone who wants to learn or master skateboarding.. He is extremely nice, reliable , encouraging and an absolute pleasure to be with!"</div>

<div class="contentbody">"Andrew Barbosa and the staff of SD Skatelife are nothing short of amazing!  Rhode Island was lucky enough to have Andrew and a staff member visit from the West Coast this summer.    My son, six years old, has been skateboarding since he's been four.  He has never had any formal instruction, but for his age he's pretty good.  After one week with Andrew, he went from good to really good for his age.  After the first week, he wanted to do a second week of camp with Andrew.  After week two, my six year old was 'airing the spine!'  Doing 'axel stalls' on the half pipe and looked more like a teenager on the skateboard than a six year old.  While what Andrew accomplished with my son was great, it's what he and his staff were able to teach my eight year old daughter in two short weeks that was nothing short of awe inspiring!</div>
<div class="contentbody">"Before starting skateboard camp with Andrew, my daughter had never skateboarded other than the week before camp when she said to me, "Daddy, can I do camp too?"  Seizing the moment, my son and I ran out and bought her a deck she had been eyeing and had the local skate shop outfit it for us.  My daughter was only one of two girls the first week with a camp of twenty boys ranging from 5 to 15.  After the first day, she was comfortable pushing around the skatepark.  After the third day, she was 'dropping in' on the small quarter pipe.  And, to note, the beginner girls of the camp were the first to do this over their boy counterparts.  After week one, she was pretty much comfortable around the entire park.  Like my son, she begged to do a second week!  On Tuesday of week two, she was 'dropping in' on the half-pipe that was four feet high, again the girls beat the their boy counterparts at doing this first.  At the end of week two, my daughter and now the two other girls, competed as a team in front of parents and friends during a fundraiser skate competition were they received fourth place!</div>
<div class="contentbody">"I am a life long educator.  What Andrew and his staff did in two weeks for my children was incredible from a personal and professional standpoint.  My son is a natural skateboarder.  Andrew took his raw skill and transformed him into a legit little skateboarder.  For my daughter, I will always be grateful for the time and energy Andrew put into teaching her how to skateboard.  Her confidence level has never been higher and this I owe all to Andrew.  SD Skatelife taught my daughter to be comfortable in her skin and not to be afraid of taking a risk (calculated safe, risks at that).  What she learned during her time with Andrew was that taking risks like 'dropping in' may be scary, but the feeling of accomplishment of overcoming your fear is life changing, even for an eight year old girl.</div>
<div class="contentbody">"The culture of respect for oneself and each other Andrew creates during his camps is second to none.  The kids have a great time, parents know their children are safe, and everyone walks away totally psyched.  I highly recommend SD Skatelife to anyone interested in introducing their child to skateboarding for the first time or to help your child take raw skill and take it to the next level.  SD Skatelife ROCKS!!!"</div>
